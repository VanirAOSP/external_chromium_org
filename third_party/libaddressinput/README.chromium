Description:
This library allows users to input their address, and perform validation on this
by talking to an address data server https://i18napis.appspot.com/ssl-address.
The library is used in requestAutocomplete() dialog to enable internationalized
address input and validation for payment forms.

Local Modifications:
The package is libaddressinput at revision 176 plus the Chrome-specific
validation logic, which will be upstreamed back to libaddressinput
(http://crbug.com/327046). The Chrome-specific version is in chromium/cpp/
subdirectory. The original source code is in src/cpp/ subdirectory. Both
versions use the original test data file src/testdata/countryinfo.txt.
